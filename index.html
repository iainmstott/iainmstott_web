					<b>INTERESTS</b> 
					<br>
					<b>Ecological systems are structured, with interacting components</b>, (e.g. 
					populations of interacting individuals, communities of interacting populations).
					Human or environmental events and pressures often affect one component more than another
					(e.g. fires kill young, not old, trees), destabilising systems. <b>I'm interested in 
					nonstable ecological system dynamics</b> (e.g. population growth rates) that result. These dynamics have 
					consequences for how ecological systems are conserved and managed. <b>I'm also 
					interested how systems evolve or develop to cope with non-stable environments</b>.
					System structures and functions that confer resilience should be favoured.
					In a separate line of work, <b>I've recently become interested in applying these approaches to 
					socio-ecological systems</b> to address inequalities through ecological justice approaches.

					<b>STUDY SYSTEMS</b> 
					<br>
					I'm fascinated by the diverse <b>life histories</b> of plants and animals, 
					Different species have vastly different patterns of survival and reproduction across the 
					their lifetimes. Working with mathematicians, I use population models to understand patterns of life history across species,
					how this impacts their <b>resilince</b>, and conversely how those dynamics feed back
					into <b>evolutionary processes</b> shaping life history.
					<br><br>
					I'm determined to use ecological science to improve the lives of people, as most people live 
					in urban areas and <b>urban ecosystems</b> are vital to human health and wellbeing. As 
					biodiversity (especially <b>urban forest</b>) is unevenly distributed across cities, access to 
					green spaces across is unequal across different communities. Working with social and 
					economic scientists, I believe that ecological models and 'big data' can provide answers to managing 
					urban green spaces for <b>ecological justice</b>.
					<br><br>
					<b>METHODS</b>
					<br>
					I work with mathematical models, statistical analysis, 
					big(-ish) data and novel software. I like a 'systems' approach, which
					considers the whole system of interest rather than individual parts: the 
					ideology and mathematics around this have their roots in engineering, 
					but borrowed across to ecology. With mathematicians, I have developed many new analytical
					tools to understand ecological systems, as well as the software to implement them. I hope to 
					work with bigger data sets and artificial intelligence approaches in the future.
					<br><br>
					<b>FUTURE</b>
					<br>
					I'd like to leverage the frameworks, methods and tools in the 
					study of other ecological systems, particularly to understand links across hierarchies of 
					biological organisation, e.g. how population resilience impacts community stability.

							WHYAGE is my Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions fellowship project, funded by the European Union.
							<br><br>
							Patterns of aging, as measured by rates of survival and reproduction across the life cycle, are
							diverse across the tree of life. In this project, myself and colleagues developed new methods of measuring aging, and
							new ways of understanding population resilience through nonstable dynamics. I applied
							these to survival and reproduction data across diverse species, to see how aging patterns
							affect population resilience. This opens a door to understanding how the responses of populations
							to disturbances influence the evolution of patterns of aging.

				<div id="whyagebody" class="content container 80%">
					Everything ages. With increasing age, we undergo physiological 
					decline, meaning we are more likely to die, and less likely to reproduce. 
					This is called ‘senescence’. Although everything ages, not everything senesces. 
					<a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12789" target = "_blank">Recent research</a> shows that some 
					organisms show constant or even increasing survival and fertility with age.
					Life spans vary from days to thousands of years. 
					<br><br>
					How did such diverse aging evolve? The ‘fittest’ life histories should have 
					highest population growth, but there’s more than one way to achieve this. 
					WHYAGE explores whether different types of aging may be adaptations to different
					types of environmental disturbance, as different patterns of survival and reproduction
					over age are better depending on which ages are most affected by the disturbance.
					<br><br>
					<div style = "padding-left: 16px; border-left: 1px solid black;">
						<b>EXAMPLE</b>
						<br><br>
						<span style = "color: #e01a35">Organism A</span> in the graph
						to the right survives better and reproduces more as it gets older (such as many
						reptiles). <span style = "color: #0707c6">Organism B</span> survives worse and reproduces less as it gets older (such as 
						many mammals). 
						<br><br>
						Pressures from humans or the environment may force certain population structures
						by killing or removing certain individuals from the population more than others: examples are extreme weather events, fire,
						disease, or harvesting by humans. If a disturbance were to remove young individuals it would
						force the population structure shown in grey. 
						<br><br>
						In this scenario, <span style = "color: #e01a35">Organism A</span> ends up with
						many older individuals that survive better and reproduce more. It therefore has high population 
						growth and recovers from the disturbance well. <span style = "color: #0707c6">Organism B</span>
						lacks individuals that survive and reproduce well, so its population growth is slow and it takes longer
						to recover. If the disturbance that forces this population structure is common, then over time there
						will be increasing numbers of organism A, because the way it ages is better adapted to living in this particular 
						environment.
					</div>
					<br><br>
					The WHYAGE project tackles these questions using comparative demography. 
					The empirical part of the project uses demographic data of thousands of 
					species (www.compadre-db.org), to measure aging across the tree of life 
					and relate this to population dynamics. The first part of the project 
					is about method development. Myself and collaborators have 
					<a href = "https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13289" target = "blank">developed new ways of measuring aging</a> using
					survival and reproduction data, and 
					<a href = "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2020.05.001" target = "blank">developed a framework for understanding resilience</a>
					of populations. These include development of open-source software for use 
					by any researcher. By analysing the relationships between aging and resilience, 
					it is possible to understand how an organism's aging affects ecological dynamics 
					of its populations. This is a first step to understanding how a species' 
					resiliences to disturbances feed back into evolution of their patterns of aging.
					<br><br>
					This work has led to cllaborative projects assessing how to understand life history, including
					a theoretical assessment of the utility of the 'fast-slow' life history paradigm, and 
					empirical assessments of (co)variation in components of aging across plants and animals.

							I work with remotely-sensed, macroecological data sets describing the 
							geography of the urban areas I study (usually in the UK). 
							<a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/mastermap-topography" target = "_blank">OS Mastermap</a>
							is an extremely high-resolution map of land cover from individual
							buildings, statues and gardens, to ecosystems such as moorland or forest. 
							The <a href="https://www.bluesky-world.com/ntm" target = "_blank">National Tree Map</a>
							is a high-resolution remotely-sensed, AI-processed map of 
							the UK's forest. These data sets have proven vital for my
							work in urban ecology.

							Urban areas are highly heterogeneous. Distinct patches of land may be 
							merely a few metres square, but provide very different ecological 
							services compared to its surroundings (e.g. a garden surrounded by
							buildings). Compared to its sister disciplines, urban ecology
							requires far higher-resolution data. Remote sensing technologies are 
							now providing this. For example, the national tree map pieces together
							aerial photography, terrain and surface data, and colour infrared imagery 
							to create a data set which outlines every single canopy and individual tree,
							including crown and height data, for the whole of England and Wales. Data sets
							such as these are making accurate contemporary urban ecological studies possible.

					Being a gay man led me into working in EDI, and I've since become heavily invested
